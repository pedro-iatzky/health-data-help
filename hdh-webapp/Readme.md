# Health Data Help


You can access to the progressive web app [here](https://healthdatahelp-e4ab1.web.app/).


## Goals

The idea is to have a very simple yet comfortable platform to have a track of the foods 
we eat during the day, and the symptoms that we notice for some common health 
conditions, such as fatigue, headaches, acne, etc.

Finally, this database should be anonymous, and public, for each one that wants to 
analyze the data.


## Why this app?

I personally suffer from the *Rosacea* condition. Through the years I have noted that the 
foods I eat are the most important factors that trigger my rosacea symptoms. 
I used to spend lots of money on treatments (doxycycline, metronidazole, etc.), 
but once I left the treatments, my symptoms came back. 

Finally, I left all the chemicals and started noticing that reducing or (ideally) 
suppressing some foods and drinks, especially coffee and alcohol, 
the symptoms were reduced or even disappeared completely. 
Some other foods, like chocolate, also seem to be pretty bad for me, that is why I 
developed this app, to take note of each food I eat, and then, be able to create models 
to get an idea of which foods are harmful (or beneficial for my health)

At the same time, some foods could act as a natural medicine, which is the most 
difficult thing to notice whitout the use of some machine learning analysis.
